# Overview
This repository contains an implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm with data standardization. K-Means is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering 
similar data points into groups. 
Standardization is applied to ensure that all features have the same scale, which is important for the effectiveness of the K-Means algorithm.

# Dataset
The project uses a MarketAnalysis.csv dataset for exploration and the finding of the clusters.

# Libraries
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. SKlearn

# Features
1. Clustering with Standardization
2. Finding the cluster number with the help of Elbow Method
3. Using a WCSS method (Within clusters sum of squares)
4. Data standardization involves transforming the features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

# Result
The result of the K Means Clustering is displayed using the relevant libraries .
